Welcome to the repository for The College Data Management System project! This project showcases my skills and knowledge as I continue my journey to become a successful data engineer.

## Project Overview

The College Data Management System is a comprehensive case study that simulates a data management solution for an imaginary college. It encompasses various steps and technologies, including database design, SQL implementation, data population, PL/SQL, Bash scripting, and Java application development.

## Key Steps of the Project

1. **Database Design:** Created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to design the database schema.
2. **SQL Implementation:** Developed the database tables using Oracle SQL.
3. **Data Population:** Generated realistic data using Python scripting to populate the database effectively.
4. **PL/SQL:** Implemented functions, procedures, and triggers to enhance database functionality.
5. **Bash Script:** Developed a Bash script to monitor disk usage and perform monthly full backups of the database.
6. **Java Application:** Built a comprehensive desktop application using Java, featuring student enrollment, grading, data visualization, and more.
